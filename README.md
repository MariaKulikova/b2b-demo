# Car Dealer Demo

A modern React application for a car dealership website featuring:

- Car inventory browsing with filtering
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS  
- Test drive booking functionality
- Contact integration (phone, WhatsApp)
- BDD testing with Cucumber & Playwright

## GitHub Pages Fix

This update ensures proper deployment from the `dist/` folder via GitHub Actions instead of serving development files from the repository root.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev      # Start development server
pnpm build    # Build for production
pnpm test     # Run BDD tests
```

The site is deployed at: https://demo.shiftgears.ai/
